This is a repo for UCAS 2022 fall Computer Graphics.:wave:

You might find it tough to learn OpenGL from scratch, I highly recommend you to follow the tutorial behind: 

> [LearnOpenGL CN (learnopengl-cn.github.io)](https://learnopengl-cn.github.io/).
>
> [01. Welcome to OpenGL_bilibili](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1MJ411u7Bc?p=1&vd_source=5d641308416d7d3f0262d27f3749b356)

> Note: The API used in the tutorials may differ from those that are frequently used in our class, but you will develop basic concepts of OpenGl when studying them.

You may also find these websites helpful when using GL and GLUT API:heavy_check_mark::

> [docs.gl](https://docs.gl/)
>
> [GLUT API, version 3 (opengl.org)](https://www.opengl.org/resources/libraries/glut/spec3/spec3.html)

If you find it tricky to get your hands on coding, you can have a glance at my reports in the folder of every experiments, which record the troubles I encountered and how I tackled them. Hopefully they could be helpful to you!:grinning:

If you are searching for some books for deeper understanding, go to the folder `Books` to see if there is any that is to your taste.
